## 17.07.22

**Previously:** I learned about the Date object and Date get mehtods.

**Today:** I plan  on learning about conditionals and arrays


**Reflections**:

- I learned about conditionals, also called control flow. 
- I learned about if statements, the ternary operator and switch
- I learned about arrays being mutable and how they can store variable data types. They can also contain arrays.
-I learned about array methods like indexOf, splice, slice, includes, lastIndexOf, join, pop, push, shift, unshift and sort
